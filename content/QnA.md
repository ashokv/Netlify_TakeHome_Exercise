#### What is your favorite thing about providing technical support?
I adore providing tech support because I learn new things troubleshooting and resolving customer issues every day. More importantly, I have a chance to better understand human emotions and the happiness in their tone (when I fix problems they were having) is what motivates me to go to any extent to find solutions.

I disagree with people when they say about having no growth in technical support. My career helped me improve technical skills and ability to view things from a different perspective that employees in other positions cannot :)

Moreover, when you troubleshoot technical issues, you will get to know that the world doesnâ€™t run the way you want and you learn how to get things done and find solutions.
