#### Rank your 5 favorite, and least favorite, activities from this list: https://gist.github.com/fool/b0f254ff8c72a5765b6a9138249789d6
*Here are things a support engineer at Netlify might do in no particular order. List 5 things that are your most favorite to do and 5 things that are least favorite.*

**Favorite**
- Respond to 60+ support requests via email or chat every day
- Analyze thousands of support tickets to spot trends to improve our product
- Suggest and champion improvements to the product and workflow to your colleagues in and out of support
- Work with the development team to help design a new feature based on feedback from customers
- Engage multiple users at once via chat to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems

##### Least Favorite
- Work with prospective customers to explain our service and the pricing model
- Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case
- Receive occasional phone calls requesting support from our highest-value customers
- Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before
- Deliver a talk to many people you don't know at a conference or meetup


#### What is your favorite thing about providing technical support?
I adore providing tech support because I learn new things troubleshooting and resolving customer issues every day. More importantly, I have a chance to better understand human emotions and the happiness in their tone (when I fix problems they were having) is what motivates me to go to any extent to find solutions.

I disagree with people when they say about having no growth in technical support. My career helped me improve technical skills and ability to view things from a different perspective that employees in other positions cannot :)

Moreover, when you troubleshoot technical issues, you will get to know that the world doesn’t run the way you want and you learn how to get things done and find solutions.


#### What did you think of our service during the time you used it?  Be honest!  “it sucked” isn’t a wrong answer unless you don’t elaborate and provide some constructive criticism ;)
I have hands-on experience updating knowledge bases using Cloud9 (an online code editor). During my time with Interakt, I used [C9](https://c9.io) to update knowledge bases where the lead developer would push updates to the production server, but it was not so practical to use on a regular basis. I think Netlify with its broader scope not only helps developers but solves every problem that distributed teams face in updating content on a daily basis.


#### Tell about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.  Briefly explain a challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it
I’ve built the website by deploying PHPoole and created three pages without any issues.

**Tools:**
- PHPoole: This lightweight website generator worked well to add a checklist and answers to your questions via Github. 
- Github: Helped me hosting all the data and all I had to do was add a few pages.


#### Could you give us a suggestion to improve this test or the job posting?
This job posting covered everything and I love the way you explained it. The linked articles were handy to learn more about the position. 

I suggest you add a Google form or [Typeform](https://typeform.com) to answer your questions directly instead of writing an email. That helps you keep track of applications and candidates can efficiently fill in.


#### Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, that you think are well done, and briefly explain why you think they are well done.
I believe support documentation of **Wistia** and **Interakt.co** are terrific.

**[Wistia's](http://wistia.com/support/)** support documentation covers everything on a single page rather than separate articles for each solution. They made good use of scrollspy navigation.

Also, each sub-topic in a page has a direct link which can be copied and shared by support staff over chat or email so visitors/users need not read the entire document.

For example,

- Embedding videos on your website
    - Generate an Embed Code
    - Inline Embeds
    - Popover Embeds
    - Troubleshooting Embed Issues

**[Interakt.co’s](http://docs.interakt.co)** interactive documentation with table of contents (linking sub-topics and FAQs) codepen snippets and widgets competes with Wistia’s elegance. I wrote all their (Interakt.co) docs :)


#### A customer writes in saying their “site won’t build”.  Compose your best short (2-paragraph) customer-facing answer without any additional data, that could be useful in the generic case but would also lead to a customer providing a more actionable response.

**Response to customer**

Hello Jane Doe,

Thank you for contacting Netlify Customer Care.

I am sorry that you are having issues deploying a website with Netlify. Could you reply us with the following details?

- What is the email address associated with Netlify and which Git provider are you trying to deploy from?
- Let us know if you are seeing any error message and kindly attach a couple of screenshots showing the error
- Please browse through our FAQ related to onboarding and let us know what happens when you follow necessary troubleshooting steps (as mentioned in FAQ # 7)

We’ll go ahead and look into the issue as soon as we get the requested information.

Should you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,
Ashok Kumar

**Internal Notes**

- It seems like they are using a different email address, so I requested them to provide their email address associated with the account
- I tried accessing their account on our end, and everything looks fine 
(@Chris I’m not sure if support engineers are allowed access customer accounts, but I want to take a chance)
- Suggested to follow necessary troubleshooting steps and will investigate into the issue after receiving error details and screenshots


#### (optional/bonus) Can you set up a redirect from “/netlify/anything” to https://www.google.com/search?q=anything ?
