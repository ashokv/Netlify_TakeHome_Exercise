#### Rank your 5 favorite, and least favorite, activities from this list: https://gist.github.com/fool/b0f254ff8c72a5765b6a9138249789d6
*Here are things a support engineer at Netlify might do in no particular order. List 5 things that are your most favorite to do and 5 things that are least favorite.*

**Favorite**
- Respond to 60+ support requests via email or chat every day
- Analyze thousands of support tickets to spot trends to improve our product
- Suggest and champion improvements to the product and workflow to your colleagues in and out of support
- Work with the development team to help design a new feature based on feedback from customers
- Engage multiple users at once via chat to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems

##### Least Favorite
- Work with prospective customers to explain our service and the pricing model
- Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case
- Receive occasional phone calls requesting support from our highest-value customers
- Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before
- Deliver a talk to many people you don't know at a conference or meetup

#### What is your favorite thing about providing technical support?
I adore providing tech support because I learn new things troubleshooting and resolving customer issues every day. More importantly, I have a chance to better understand human emotions and the happiness in their tone (when I fix problems they were having) is what motivates me to go to any extent to find solutions.

I disagree with people when they say about having no growth in technical support. My career helped me improve technical skills and ability to view things from a different perspective that employees in other positions cannot :)

Moreover, when you troubleshoot technical issues, you will get to know that the world doesn’t run the way you want and you learn how to get things done and find solutions.

#### What did you think of our service during the time you used it?  Be honest!  “it sucked” isn’t a wrong answer unless you don’t elaborate and provide some constructive criticism ;)
I have hands-on experience updating knowledge bases using Cloud9 (an online code editor). During my time with Interakt, I used [C9](https://c9.io) to update knowledge bases where the lead developer would push updates to the production server, but it was not so practical to use on a regular basis. I think Netlify with its broader scope not only helps developers but solves every problem that distributed teams face in updating content on a daily basis.

#### Tell about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.  Briefly explain a challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it
I’ve built the website by deploying PHPoole and created three pages without any issues.

**Tools:**
- PHPoole: This lightweight website generator worked well to add a checklist and answers to your questions via Github. 
- Github: Helped me hosting all the data and all I had to do was add a few pages.

#### Could you give us a suggestion to improve this test or the job posting?
This job posting covered everything and I love the way you explained it. The linked articles were handy to learn more about the position. 

I suggest you add a Google form or [Typeform](https://typeform.com) to answer your questions directly instead of writing an email. That helps you keep track of applications and candidates can efficiently fill in.
