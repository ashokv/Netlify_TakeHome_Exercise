<h3 style="color:#F24800; text-align:center">Ashok Kumar</h3>

<h6 style="color:#444; text-align:center">FAN OF TECHNOLOGY AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP</h6>

<p style="color:#444; text-align:center">I started my working life as a computer trainer, but enthusiasm for startups and dream of one day becoming an entrepreneur soon steered my career in a different direction.</p>

<p style="color:#444; text-align:center">In my 11+ year of experience, it seems like I've seen it all. I've worked as a trainer, freelance web developer and customer success specialist for many, many startups. It's the startup world that intrigues me the most and keeps pulling me back time and again â€” even after three startups stuck in development limbo!</p>
